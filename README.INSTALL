Installing RTAI-3.x
===================

0. RTAI 3.9.1
================================

RTAI uses only the leanest and fastest RTAI+Linux combination now, i.e. it
dispatches real time interrupts immediately. Moreover within such a scheme
i386 has the possibility of completely avoiding the dispatching of critical
internal timers and interprocessor scheduling interrupts by vectoring them
directly to their handlers. Such an option strongly enhances performances
on low end machines and comes by default. You can disable it while configuring
RTAI though. See the related configuration helper.
What above requires you to patch Linux just with patches found within this
distribution.
Notice also that this release is for use with:
- i386,
- x86_64,
- PPC.

On recent distributions, managing udev/sysfs, devices created by following
this installation procedure will disappear at each machine halting. Then they
will be available no more at the next reboot. RTAI should manage udev/sysfs
support but in case something weird will impede it you can solve your problem
quickly by restoring RTAI devices before running your application. For that
the following short script containing:
------------------------------ cut here -------------------------------------
if test \! -c /dev/rtai_shm; then
        mknod -m 666 /dev/rtai_shm c 10 254
fi
for n in `seq 0 9`; do
        f=/dev/rtf$n
        if test \! -c $f; then
                mknod -m 666 $f c 150 $n
        fi
done
------------------------------ cut here -------------------------------------
should suffice.

1. How to build
===============

1.1 Standard procedure
----------------------

The RTAI build system is a merge of Linux's Kconfig with
autoconf/automake/libtool.

You must first prepare your build system to generate a configure file:

$ ./autogen.sh

This also configures RTAI with the default configuration and the
non-interactive configuration flags may be passed.

See sections below for interactive and non-interactive configurations.

1.1.1 Interactive configuration
-------------------------------

Preparing the build system, ./autogen.sh attemps a bogus configuration just
to produce makefiles so the interactive configuration can execute.

To launch the interactive configuration screen:

$ make menuconfig

Other targets similar to the Linux kernel's configuration are also available.

Save your configuration and run "make". This would first reconfigure the build
with the new configuration and then proceed with the actual build/

1.1.2 Non-interactive configuration
-----------------------------------

You may directly call the configure script:

$ ./configure

The available configuration switches can be listed by running ./configure --help.
The RTAI-specific switches are:

 --enable-trace		Enable trace support
 --enable-math		Enable math support
 --enable-bits		Enable bits IPC support
 --enable-fifos		Enable fifo IPC support
 --enable-netrpc	Enable netrpc support
 --enable-netrpc-rtnet	Enable use of RTNet

 --enable-verbose-latex Uses LaTeX non-stop mode
 --enable-compat	Enable compatibility mode
 --enable-module-debug	Enable debug information in kernel modules
 --enable-user-debug	Enable debug information in user-space programs

Some configuration targets in base/ can either produce a module,
or be statically linked to the RTAI schedulers. Either pass "m" for
the modular build to their respective --enable-xxx switch, or "y" for
selecting the built-in mode.

To build, run make:

$ make

1.2 Installing the software
---------------------------

When the standard compilation has finished:

# make install

Everything needed to use the RTAI distribution will be copied there
out of the build tree. From now on, you should be able to refer to the
installation directory as the root of a complete standalone binary
RTAI distribution.

One may also choose to install the RTAI programs under a temporary
staging tree by passing the standard DESTDIR variable to "make" while
installing. e.g.

# make install DESTDIR=/mnt/target

will create a standard RTAI hierarchy under /mnt/target, keeping the
original prefix information unmodified. If the installation directory
selected at configuration time was "/usr/realtime", then the command
above will put the RTAI binary distribution under
/mnt/target/usr/realtime.

WARNING: running "make install" is required to run several standard
RTAI programs correctly. RTAI 3.x enforces the actual split between
the source distribution tree, the build tree where RTAI is going to be
compiled, and the final installation directory where RTAI programs can
be run eventually. In any case, you should only rely on the
installation directory contents to run RTAI programs.

NOTE: Do not pay attention to the "*** Warning" messages appearing on
module compilation output. They are harmless and will be fixed later.

1.3 Compiling parts of the tree
-------------------------------

RTAI developers may want to recompile parts of the tree from times to
times. This automake-based build system allows it: just go to the
proper directory level, then issue "make", as usual. This process will
recurse as needed.

Please note that you must have already ran ./autogen.sh and have
configured your RTAI tree using either ./configure or make menuconfig

1.4 Changing the configuration
------------------------------

Each time you want to change your configuration, just run "make
menuconfig" in your build dir, then "make" (or "make
all").

If you only want to rerun the "configure" script, you may
do so using ./configure or using the ./autogen.sh script

When invoked for the first time in an empty build directory, the
default "make" goal is "menuconfig" in a regular terminal.

1.5 Modifying the autotool template files
-----------------------------------------

If you have to change some template files used by any of the autotools
(i.e. Makefile.am, configure.ac, acinclude.m4), then you will need the
following pack to rebuild the derived files:

o autoconf 2.68 or 2.69
o automake 1.12.6 or 1.13.2
o aclocal 1.12.6 or 1.13.2
o libtool 2.4 or 2.4.2

1.6 Using the integrated calibration tool
-----------------------------------------

RTAI 3.x comes with a brand new calibration tool which should help you
determining if your hardware platform is up to the hard real-time
duties. You can find this tool under $installdir/calibration. Here is
the output of this tool's help message for x86-based platforms:

$ ./calibration --help

OPTIONS:
  -h, --help
      print usage
  -r, --r8254
      calibrate 8254 oneshot programming type
  -k, --kernel
      oneshot latency calibrated for scheduling kernel space tasks
  -u, --user
      oneshot latency calibrated for scheduling user space tasks
  -p <period (us)>, --period <period (us)>
      the period of the underlying hard real time task/intr, default 100 (us)
  -t <duration (s)>, --time <duration (s)>
      set the duration of the requested calibration, default 5 (s)
  -c, --cpufreq
      calibrate cpu frequency
  -a, --apic
      calibrate apic frequency
  -b, --both
      calibrate both apic and cpu frequency
  -i, --interrupt
      check worst case interrupt locking/contention on your PC
  -s<y/n>, --scope<y/n>
      toggle parport bit to monitor scheduling on a scope, default y(es)

2. Bootstrapping with vulcano in 7 steps
========================================

>1. patch and build a vanilla Linux kernel tree with the RTAI support as
    usual. Patches for x86 are available from
    vulcano/base/arch/i386/patches/. Apply only one of them
    that matches the Linux kernel version, like this:
    $ cd $linux-src-dir
    $ patch -p1 < base/arch/$arch/patches/patchfile

>2. $ mkdir $builddir && cd $builddir

>3. $ make -f ../vulcano/makefile srctree=../vulcano

>4. a GUI should pop up, allowing you to configure RTAI:
    o default settings should be ok for most platforms
    o in the "General" section, set your site values for the RTAI
      installation directory (defaults to /usr/realtime) and
      Linux kernel tree (defaults to /usr/src/linux).
    o save and exit.

--

At this point, you should see the typical output of a GNU configure
script. Your RTAI settings are being used to setup the
autoconf/automake-based build system.

--

>5. $ make install

RTAI will be compiled then installed under the directory you specified
at configuration time (ensure that your shell can write to the
destination directory).

Remember to add $installdir/bin to your shell PATH variable, where
$installdir is your site value for the RTAI installation directory.

--

>6. $ cd $installdir/testsuite/kern/latency

>7. $ ./run

If "sudo" is installed on your box, the application loader script
(rtai-load) will attempt to use it for running privileged commands
(e.g. insmod, rmmod et al.) If sudo is not available, just "su"
manually before running the run script. You should then see the
typical output of the latency calibration program running in kernel
space.  Hit ^C to stop it.
