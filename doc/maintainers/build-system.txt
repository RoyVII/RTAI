Description of the build system
-------------------------------

1. Motivations
--------------

The RTAI build system is a merge of Linux's 3.9 Kconfig with
autoconf/automake/libtool. The following requirements led to such
mixed system:

o GUI-based configuration.
o Cross-compilation support.
o Compilation of C and C++ kernel modules.
o Full shared library support (C/C++).
o C++ compilation of hosts programs.
o Compilation of GUI (X-based).
o Script-based configuration (for automatic mode).
o Initial support for profile-based configurations.
o Reliable (host) feature detection framework.

2. Dynamics
-----------

The dynamics of the system is as follows:

=> Kconfig/Menuconfig-based configuration (GUI-aided)

  $ make menuconfig,xconfig,gconfig

         |
         | 1. Produces .rtai_config
	      (Kconfig format: CONFIG_RTAI_FEATURE=<value> or unset)
         | 2. Runs ./configure --with-kconfig-file=.rtai_config
         v

=> Script level configuration (automatic or manual). The configure
script can either be controlled by individual options passed to it, or
fed with a configuration file in Kconfig format.

  Automatic mode (spawned right after kconfig):
	./configure --with-kconfig-file=.rtai_config

  Manual mode (from the user CLI):
	./configure --enable-feature-x --with-param-y=n

         |
         | 1. Applies a set of reasonable defaults for unset parameters.
	 | 2. Auto-detects host features as required.
	 | 3. Produces config.h and Makefiles.
         v

=> Compilation

   $ make

3. Bootstrapping
----------------

RTAI needs to be configured prior to being built, but the
configuration tool cannot rely on autoconf-generated Makefiles to
build itself. Therefore, the GUI-aided configuration system which
depends on dynamically built programs is bootstrapped by a simple
"Makefile" at the root of the source tree.

The bootstrap Makefile traps the targets needed to build and run the
Kconfig tool (make menuconfig|xconfig|gconfig), and invokes the
self-contained base/config/kconfig/Makefile.kconfig makefile which in
turn builds and run the configuration GUI as required. Upon return of
the GUI-based configuration session, the bootstrap Makefile (re)runs
autoconf's "configure" script as needed to take the configuration
changes into account.

Once the configuration script has been run successfully at least once,
there is no more need to use the bootstrap Makefile located in the
source tree, since the top-level autoconf-generated GNUMakefile will be
available in the build tree, and handle the menuconfig, xconfig,
gconfig and other targets appropriately (actually, menuconfig, xconfig
and gconfig are silently passed to the boostrap Makefile by the
autoconf-generated one so that we do not duplicate rather complex
rules uselessly).

4. Dependencies
---------------

The build system is based on:

o Kconfig as extracted from Linux 3.9. The X-based configuration front-ends
either needs Qt (xconfig) or GTK2 (gconfig), and the dialog-based one
depends on ncurses.
o Autoconf >= 2.68
o Automake >= 1.11
o Libtool >= 1.5.8
