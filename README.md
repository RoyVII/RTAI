RTAI
====

This is a clone of RTAI from https://www.rtai.org.  **The master branch of this
repository may have additional features or bug fixes and may not be supported
by Paolo Mantegazza (the main developer and owner of RTAI).**  However, I try
to keep branches named after the RTAI modules up-to-date with their development
in the original CVS ropository at https://gna.org/cvs/?group=rtai.
